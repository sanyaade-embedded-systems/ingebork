ingebork
============================
ingebork is a dwm 5.5 fork with changes that seem useful to me and my friends.
it is by no means supposed to compete with dwm!


Requirements
------------
In order to build ingebork you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (ingebork is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install ingebork (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running ingebork
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start ingebork using startx:

    exec ingebork

In order to connect ingebork to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec ingebork

(This will start ingebork on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while true
    do
        xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
        sleep 1
    done &
    exec ingebork

If you want to colorize text, you can use HTML colors.
The default delimiter is '|', you can change it in the config file.

Example:
"|#ffffff| This is white. |#000000| This is black."


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of ingebork is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
